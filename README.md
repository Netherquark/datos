A C-based dataset analyzer (mini project for FY: PC-L)

## Problem Statement

Develop functions to compute the standard deviation and variance of a dataset.

### Project Details

* **Project Management Style:** Agile TDD
* **Coding Style:** GNU
* **Build System:** CMake
* **Testing Methodology:** Unit testing + Integration testing using GTest
* **Documentation:** Doxygen
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## Checklist

1. [ ] Initialize CMake build system.
2. [ ] Configure CMake for the project.
3. [ ] Write user stories for calculating standard deviation and variance.
4. [ ] Define acceptance criteria for each user story.
5. [ ] Create a GitHub issue tracking each user story.
6. [ ] Create test cases for each acceptance criteria.
7. [ ] Organize tests into unit tests and integration tests.
8. [ ] Write failing GTest test files for standard deviation and variance calculation.
9. [ ] Implement functions for standard deviation and variance calculation.
10. [ ] Document function signatures and purpose using Doxygen comments.
11. [ ] Write integration tests to verify interactions between components.
12. [ ] Document code using Doxygen comments.
13. [ ] Generate documentation using Doxygen. Review and update documentation as needed.
14. [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and building.
15. [ ] Configure GitHub Actions to run unit tests and integration tests on each push.
16. [ ] Ensure build artifacts are generated and packaged correctly.
17. [ ] Conduct code reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to coding style.
18. [ ] Refactor code for clarity, performance, and maintainability.
19. [ ] Update tests and documentation as needed based on code changes.
20. [ ] Tag a release version in Git once the features are complete and stable.
21. [ ] Update release notes with changes and improvements.
22. [ ] Make the release artifacts available for distribution.
