A C-based dataset analyzer (mini project for FY: PC-L)

## Problem Statement

Develop functions to compute the standard deviation and variance of a dataset.

### Project Details

* **Project Management Style:** Agile TDD
* **Coding Style:** GNU
* **Build System:** CMake
* **Testing Methodology:** Unit testing + Integration testing using GTest
* **Documentation:** Doxygen
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## Checklist

- [X] Initialize CMake build system.
